# Slide Top Box

A simple box with a notched slidable lid.

## Notes:
- lid needs a "handle" or nobby to make it easier to open
- lid was tight with current dimensions, we need to make it a touch shorter
- print on the box came out a bit sloppy around the notch, we need chamfing to make the edges easier for the printer.
